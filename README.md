# Chess Ai
In this project we will be building a AI chess bot that learns how to play chess better as it plays more chess games.

We've bulit on top of a basic 2-player chess program built by Lakhvinder "Lucky" Jordan. Find out more about it here: https://github.com/ljordan51/ChessGame/blob/master/chess.py

To run game, you must have Pygame installed. If you need to install, navigate to folder containing chess.py and run:  
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
